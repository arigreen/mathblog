**Problems 11-20 study elimination on 3 by 3 systems (and possible failure).**

## Problem 11
A system of linear equations can't have exactly two solutions. Why?
- If $(x,y,z)$ and $(X,Y,Z)$ are two solutions, what is another solution?
- If 25 planes meet at two points, where else do they meet?

## Solution 11
The solution to a system of linear equations must be either: no solution, a single point, or at the very least
a line. It could also be a 3 or higher dimensional space.
= If $(x,y,z)$ and $(X,Y,Z)$ both line on the same plane, then all other points
on that plane are also solutions. For example, the point halfway between those
two is $(x+X,y+Y,z+Z)$. If they do not lie on the same plane, then all
points in the space must be solution.
- If 25 planes meet at two points, they must also meet at the line that contains
    those two points.
::: note
Remember, an easy way to find a 3rd point on the same plane as 2 other points is
to take the point in the middle of the first two!
